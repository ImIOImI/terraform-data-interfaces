# Terraform Data Interfaces
This is currently a WIP project. The goal is to be able to annotate resources with comments, and build an interface 
module using autogenerated code that does data queries (so the module doesn't rely on the producing project's state) 
after a tofu or terraform apply has ran. 

## Dependencies
You must have either OpenTofu or Terraform installed. I highly recommend that you install tenv (a version manager written 
to manage both OpenTofu and Terraform)
